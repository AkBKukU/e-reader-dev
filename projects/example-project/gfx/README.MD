# Graphics

The graphics tool [grit](https://github.com/devkitPro/grit) is a more advanced 
graphics conversion utility that can create C arrays for importing directly. It supports many different kinds of graphic input formats. You can adjust the `makefile` to include whatever file formats are needed.
